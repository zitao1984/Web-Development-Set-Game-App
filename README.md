# Web-Development-Set-Game-App
## Description
I created a popular single player card game called (SET)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)].  When users enter my app, they should see a welcome page that contains nothing but the title of the game  and links to a “rules” page and the main “game” page.  In this game, a single player must identify a set of cards that match certain rules until all the cards have been sorted into sets.
